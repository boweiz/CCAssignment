	we could use external sort to approach this question.
	Since the data size is very large, and the memory is limited.
	So each time, we just bring part of the data into memory.
	for example, we can divide the file into chunks which are n megabytes each, where 
	n is the amount of memory we have available.
	we sort each chunk separately and then save them to the file system.
	once all the chunks are sorted, we merge the chunks one by one, and have a fully sorted file.
